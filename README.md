### An online multiplayer game about... bread.

Run around, or, slide around (?), in search of ingredients to grow yourself as a bread.
Slice others to hinder their progress and strive to become the number one bread in the world!

This whole project was put together in 3 days for the [Jame Gam: IO Edition](https://itch.io/jam/jame-gam-io). You can find the original entry [here](https://rickroll.de/).

### Controls

WASD to move around,
Mouse click throughout the world to slice.
